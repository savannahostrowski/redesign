      <h3>here are some fun facts about me:</h3>
        <h4>i'm (pretty much) entirely self-taught </h4>
          <p>i actively started to code jan. 2015. for about <a href="https://github.com/savannahostrowski">210 days</a>. i built whatever i could get my hands on - the first two versions of this website, games using HTML5 canvas, a python script to zip my files, site map crawlers to find errors etc. <strike>learned</strike> learning a lot, <strike>wasn't</strike> isn't easy but was totally worth it.

        <h4>i'm not your average computer-science grad</h4>
          <p>i say pretty much entirely self-taught because my undergrad at uwaterloo is, in some ways, related to development. i'm currently attending uw for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomatics">geomatics</a>
